	\subsubsection{Blocking and non-blocking operations}
		The lecture slides define a blocking operation in the following way: 
		\textit{'Blocking: The return of the operation on a process ensures that the local resources (buffers) can be reused.'} 
		
		In contradiction, \textit{'a non-blocking operation does not guarantee that the local resources can be reused after returning to the process.}
